Hi! I am an incoming PhD student in Economics at UC Berkeley. My current research focus is on theoretically-inclined Behavioral Economics and Political Economy.
      
Since 2024, I have been a Pre-Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Matthew Rabin](https://rabin.scholars.harvard.edu/). I received my BA in Economics from the Sao Paulo School of Economics â€“ FGV and my Bachelor of Law from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2023.

You can reach me via email at {{< mail >}}
