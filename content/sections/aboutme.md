I am a Pre-Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Economics at Harvard University, working under the supervision of Prof. [Matthew Rabin](https://scholar.harvard.edu/rabin).

I received my BA in Economics from the Sao Paulo School of Economics -- FGV and my Bachelor of Law from the University of Sao Paulo in 2023. In 2022, I was a visiting undergraduate student at Harvard College.

I am especially interested in Behavioral Economics and Political Economy.
