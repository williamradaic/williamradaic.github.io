      People often act under social pressure, choosing whether to conform to popular tastes. I identify two distinct perceived sources of social pressure: *action-based* judgment, in which approval depends on choosing an action that matches the audience's opinions; and *taste-based* judgment, in which audiences approve of people who are believed to share their private tastes. While action-based judgment creates a simple choice under uncertainty, taste-based judgment induces a signaling game. I formally define how these two perceived sources of social judgment translate into utility functions, and using a simple static game, draw out the implications of each assumption for behavior and welfare. While the results are structurally similar, they are driven by distinct mechanisms and generate some contrasting results. Notably, action-based social pressure implies generally unique predictions, whereas the signaling dynamics inherent in taste-based social pressure induce multiple equilibria. I discuss these results in light of the current literature on conformity and social norms, and intuitively consider extensions in which each source of social judgment generates distinct predictions.
